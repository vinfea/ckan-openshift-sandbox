1) start_ckan.sh.override

This would be a pull request to ckan-docker-base. There are multiple ckan versions this change would have to cover (2.10, 2.11, etc), with dev and non-dev for each.

The remaining files are modifications to ckan-docker.

2) Dockerfile (and Dockerfile.dev)

XLoader is installed here. Users can modify the Dockerfile if they don't want XLoader.

3) Replace the datapusher setup script with the xloader one.

4) .env.example

Replaced datapusher with xloader in the active plugins. Removed datapusher related env vars. Added one build argument for ckan service (XLOADER_VERSION).

5) docker-compose.yaml (and docker-compose.dev.yml)

Currently, XLoader related env vars are directly in the compose.
