PLAN:

Goal 1) Get minimal ckan deployment running in Openshift sandbox
- ckan-base
- postgres db
- solr (for searching)

Start with ckan-docker repo:
https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker/tree/master

STEPS:
- Go through Dockerfile for each container (if applicable)
- Customize if needed
- Also reference docker-compose.yml
- Build new images and push to quay repo, located here:
https://quay.io/repository/akatsuki/ckan-on-openshift
- Write Kubernetes config files (YAMLs) to pull those images and configure
the components to run within the Openshift sandbox
- Pray it works
