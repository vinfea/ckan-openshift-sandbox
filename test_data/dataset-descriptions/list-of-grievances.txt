Subject: Sung Jin-Woo

Mr. Goto,

It has come to my attention that your "acquaintance," the man who calls himself Sung Jin-Woo, broke the arm of one of our B-rank hunters yesterday. Said B-rank hunter claims you arrived at the scene, gave him a look of cold disdain, and goaded Sung into a spar.

This acquaintance of yours, despite not being a hunter of our guild (or a registered hunter or citizen of any known country, for that matter--which fucking yakuza did you drag him out of?), can enter the guildmaster's office as he pleases (something otherwise unheard of, as you well know), wander the rest of headquarters (not matter security clearances, since none of the staff wish to die), spectate on raids, and act completely at his discretion. Many have raised the reasonable concern that this is too much freedom.

Please consider that this much favouritism is dangerous, inappropriate, and disruptive for the guild. In Shimizu's words, "Get a room." In Kanae's words, "What the fuck happened in Hokkaido, and can [you] go back?" (Please do not, in actuality, go back, as you have used up most of your vacation days for the fiscal year and have 12 A-rank gates scheduled for this week). Finally, in Izawa's highly pertinent words, "I've wanted to sleep with the guildmaster for like, what, five years now, and this random Korean pretty boy seduces him instead?"

To avoid exacerbating existing chaos and resentment, please improve your professionalism and hold Sung Jin-Woo to reasonable expectations when on guild property.

Sincerely,

(Get your shit together),

Sugimoto Reiji
