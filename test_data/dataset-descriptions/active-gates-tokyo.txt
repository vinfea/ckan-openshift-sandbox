A-rank gates are only to be raided by teams Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. A core of at least three S-ranks (tank, assassin, and healer) is required. Additionally having an S-rank mage is recommended.

B-rank gates can be raided by all teams. If an S-rank is present, there are no additional requirements. If no S-ranks are present, at least 5 members of the strike team must be A-rank.

NO EXCEPTIONS APPLY (Goto Ryuji, so help me god, that INCLUDES you).

In the event of casualties, please direct relatives to our human resources department.
